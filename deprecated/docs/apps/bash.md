# Borne Again Shell

Unlike Z-Shell, in which I have a rather large and opinionated configuration, the BASH shell configuration included here is rather minimal but does provide some quality of life features I need in case I am forced to work with it instead of ZSH for a specific purpose.

## Quality of Life Features

### BASHRC

The `.bashrc` file included in this repository includes a statement to insure it does not run non-interactively and the necessary directives for the use of the Node Version Manager, which I use often for web development purposes.

### BASHENV

In the `.bashenv` file there are links to my aliases and common `.profile` to insure my specific aliases and shell-agnostic configurations are present to minimize frustrations or tedious command entry in case I am working in BASH. They are included here so they are present for non-interactive (script) purposes.
