# Deprecated Files 

The files within this subdirectory are my deprecated scripts useful when I used Arch Linux as the base for my system. This is no longer the case, I have moved on to Alpine Linux as it offers OpenRC as its init system, which I find much more pleasant to work with (even though it means missing out on NixOS), increased grain of control over the system, a much faster package manager and has a significant community presence complete with corporate interest in its continuation that means it is not going to vanish suddenly nor tomorrow. 

The incomplete docs produced with these scripts are also included, new docs will come soon to replace those. The purpose of keeping them is like the install script, to give me a starting point in my rewrite and enable Arch users to still benefit from my experience (until I decide to dispatch of those files since they are in the repo's history anyway).
