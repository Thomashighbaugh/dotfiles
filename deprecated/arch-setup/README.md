# Deprecated Files

The files within this subdirectory are my deprecated scripts useful when I used Arch Linux as the base for my system. This is no longer the case, I have moved on to Alpine Linux as it offers OpenRC as its init system, which I find much more pleasant to work with (even though it means missing out on NixOS), increased grain of control over the system, a much faster package manager and has a significant community presence complete with corporate interest in its continuation that means it is not going to vanish suddenly nor tomorrow.
