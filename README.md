# Dotfiles 
## Thomas Leon Highbaugh 

### Quick Start // Personal Reference 
>>> Run `make` for all or `make {vim,zsh,..}` for individual components.

## Introduction 
> These are my dotfiles, there are many like them but these are mine. 
This is the repository for my dotfiles. **But what are dotfiles?** They are
files used by the programs I typically run to set preferences, configurations,
etc that I prefer to have backed up on GitHub//GitLab over reconfiguring when
using a new system or after reinstalling my current one. 

## Custom Awesome WM Theme 
Included in this repository are my two custom window manager themes, Dracula and
Palenight, for Awesome Window Manager. Like all custom Awesome themes, this set
up includes some personal configurations and is organized in a way that is
suited to my taste, so you may or may not find them useful to adapt to your own
configuration. 

These themes come with custom GTK themes, however you will have to adapat
program colors from Palenight to Dracula yourself for all the other programs.
For this purposes, I reccomend using Oomox's base16 templates.

## My Set Up
These dotfiles were written for use on Manjaro with Awesome WM installed. This
particular repo is for my laptop, another exists for my desktop and eventually
another will exist for my hypervisor system. _Yes I could simply include them
all in one repo and simply navigate to one subdirectory depending on the system,
that will be tested soon._
