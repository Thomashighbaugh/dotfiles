## Introduction

A repo, on Github featuring dotfiles and an installation script bring an Arch system from first boot to totally useful to me and just the way I like it.

## Features

- Extensive
- Modular
- No Submodules
- Install script
  - Idemponent
  - Unattended Installation/Configuration
  - Customizable to Your System/Needs Using TUI Selection Menu

## How To

Brave soul I presume? Well lucky you, if you have nothing to do, try these relatively painless steps on a fresh install of Arch Linux and you are good to go.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
sh install.sh
```

Then the `./INSTALL` will:
- Display a prompt then take you to a categorical menu
- From there you can select a category, but first select the first item `Core Dependencies ` (**You must do this for the rest of the installer to work**)
- in each submenu you will be able to select options with the the arrow keys and spacebar
- then hit enter and they will install and provision as needed.
