** Eisenhower Priority Matrix 
- Introducing the new paradigm for organizing daily tasks in a more dynamic way that merely assigning them to categories, which will be done still of course. This is a means of ranking them within a system that enables me to take care of the pressing issues first and better focus my berserker fury on tasks that will yield me the most relief from stress as I knock them out. 
  - Somewhat like a formalized variant of the system I seem to naturally use. Adoption should be easy enough for that reason. 
  - fits into the system now forged using org mode but still possible to record on pad and paper. 
- intended to reduce distractions 
  - not to be used to classify activities with the woman or dog, both are exceedingly urgent and important as they enable or inhibit the rest.

| Important & Urgent                                                        | Important, Not Urgent                                                           |
| -  'Do Now'                                                               | - Schedule & Do ASAP                                                            |
| - Including Deadline, Crises, Family, Last Minute Preparations            | - Health & Relationships                                                        |
| - tend towards financial ramifications, employment, sustaining life       | - Self development & Learning                                                   |
| - the goal is to have scheduled out everything so these stop being urgent | - These tasks require full attentive capacity that will be had if scheduled for |
