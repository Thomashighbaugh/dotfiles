This DOCKERFILE exists as a means of testing the installation script provided here, which makes the installation of the system automated instead of the menu-driven system I have used in the `./INSTALL` script that allows for more customization and useful on various systems locally, such as servers or vms running headlessly which don't need GUI programs, my rpi4 which has a different architecture and my laptop which requires the use of the thinkpad packages.However, in regards to my workstation, I don't really need to sit through the whole process of selecting each program on the menu and like having all the packages easily installed with one command.

I am thinking of moving to a menu system where I select the system being installed after either first going through the packages common to each system or possibly selecting first the system and then installing those packages useful to all with a function that depending on which is selected will then go through the packages for that system. Since I am evidently not good enough (cough don't use mac cough)for `Awesome Dotfiles` I suppose enabling my dotfiles to be useful universally with the installer is just wasting my own time locally anyway.
