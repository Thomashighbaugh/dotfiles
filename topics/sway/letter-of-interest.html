To Whom This May Concern,

I am writing you this letter of interest as part of my application packet for the position of Assistant Director of Web Development, UX and Content at CSU San Jose, which I believe myself a uniquely perfect candidate for. Before deciding upon tech as the industry that I wanted to invest my passion and energies into, I had studied and earned a degree in political science from CSU East Bay in my native Hayward. After graduating cum laude, obtaining a 98th percentile LSAT score and moving to Floridia, I found myself struck with what at the time seemed a fatal illness and began re-evulating my life. Having eventually having the prospect of death lifted from me, my former career trajectory had shifted radically and during the times I was nursing my illness, I picked up a broad interest in technologies that has still not left me. Having spent the last three, almost four, years learning both Linux and front end development, I have amassed a range of skills that have either interested me or were pertinent to my needs along the way. An example is my resume, which I wrote in Latex, having learned how to use it after being dissatisfied with the template options available to the public and deciding to write my own with the same system that academics use in the creation of academic papers meant for peer-review and publication as it offered the richest functionality to achieving my purpose while enabling me to create the same attractive interface type that I have a particular hand for writing and proofing out myself. 

For the last two years of this process, I have been a freelancer who has leveraged the customers of my computer repair business, who are mostly small business owners without technical savvy, as a marketing base enabling me to create web front ends for their business using bleeding edge technology stacks, in particular React and one of several static site generators (Gatsby.js, Next.js, etc) and leveraging the JAMstack hosting services to mitigate expensive and continuing overhead for them. Unfortunately, work has dried up during the pandemic and now I am seeking more stable renumeration for my continuing efforts. This experience has taught me quite a bit about the process of doing business in general, as I am solely responsible for its operation along the cycle from sending the customer my drafts and mockups to the maintaining of the web interface after the site is completed. As is naturally a requisite skill in such a context, my sales and interpersonal dialogue acumen has naturally have become very pronounced and comprise part of the overall work ethic I bring with me to the projects that I work on. 

Through this process of learning these technologies and deploying them professionally, I have found that the aspect of them that I am most particularly focused on is that of the interface from the perspective of the user. Remembering how only recently enough, I too was a member of the technologically uninterested population that had no choice but navigating websites that were made by the insular communities of web development, I have sought to mitigate the frustrations I had had and those that others brought up to me in crafting my own websites. Being someone with a soft spot in my heart for those who need accessibility functionality to properly navigate the web, I have additionally sought to include those standards without exception in these websites, even if it is not convenient to do so. 

As I have mentioned above, I have additionally learned the quirks and vast potentials of the Linux operating system, having taken to its exclusive use when learning the various web development technologies I now know and love as it is the same operating system that the vast majority of websites are hosted on and the first interest in technology that really stirred me. One avenue of this utilization of the Linux kernel that I have wandered down has been the customization of my desktop environment to suit my specific taste and optimize my workflow, which is itself an exercise in mastering the user experience in a radically different context and has required that I learn the otherwise somewhat useless language of Lua for the realization of my intended goal. The result has been that I have crafted an expansive customization of the Awesome Window Manager program that is very specifically dialed in to my workflow and taste in the novel and rather cumbersome language of Lua which I will add a link to in the additional addendum attached to this application packet. 

Also attached will be various websites, and links to their source code, that I feel specifically address the needs of San Jose State in populating this particular case which I will label accordingly for purposes of making it more convenient and preventing you from needing to divine my rationale for their inclusion. Having stated this intent, I would like to make a breif mention of some of these skills as a means of insuring that it is made clear that I do possess the relevant and necessary skills for being a successful addition to your organization and its efforts. In particular I have a broad and deep knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript, which is in part the reason that you are reading this in HTML format, and is something that there is more than ample proof of in just my portfolio site, which is written in React that uses JSX as a means of including the HTML within the Javascript and styled with a combination of SCSS, a pre-processed CSS variant enabling the use of variables and other more common programming structures, as well as Styled Components which are essentially internal stylesheets that enable more <i>atomic</i> design, which is all the rage these days. As far as my prowess as a graphics designer, I again point to my portfolio site which features my logo which I personally designed in the top left-hand corner and functions as a home button. While unaware that I would actually take an interest in the graphics aspect of websites, I have found myself the master of GIMP recently and for artistic purposes exploring machine learning as a way of remastering pictures I take in various styles using what is called 'Style Transfer', an aspect of Deep Learning where the machine is taught to transfer the style of one picture to another. While my graphics design prowess is self taught and idiosyncratic, I am confident that my skills are sufficient for these purposes as the attractive nature of my interfaces utilize these skills in particular and my artwork is rather well liked when it is posted on Instagram or Dribbble, links to both will be included in the addendum as well. 

I would like to include this letter of interest by thanking you for baring with me as I stitched together the divergent streams of my character that have emerged in my pursuit of technology as a career path. While rooted in a field far removed from what it is that I do on a daily basis, as I have turned this downturn into a time of learning as a matter of course for my interests align with my career path, I feel that in this particular case this is extremely helpful as I have an academic depth to my knowledge of the role of administration in a public organization sufficient that I would excel in such a role. I would also like to take the oppurtunity of providing my contact information which is as follows. I am most quickly responsive to email, as I get a lot of spam phone calls, and the email I currently use is thighbaugh@zoho.com. At present I have two phone numbers, if you prefer such channels of communication, the first is my new cell 510-309-5128 and my old cell number I am keeping as I transition is 510-907-0654. If you would like to move forward with my candidacy as you agree I would make a strong contender for the role of Assistant Director of Web Development, UX and Content at San Jose State, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon. 

Thank you for your time and consideration,
