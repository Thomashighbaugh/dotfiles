# Dotfiles 
## Laptop Configuration 

### Quick Start // Personal Reference 
>>> Run `make` for all or `make {vim,zsh,..}` for individual components.

## Mobile Development Environment 

These files store the configuration of my laptop workstation, which is intended to be roughly equivalent to my main desktop environment with specific modifications for the limitations imposed by the mobile platform. 

### Needs for Mobile System
- function deployments of IDEs and tools for development 
- ability to function in cases where desktop is not practical or impossible to utilize 
- ability to read the desktop's file system's in case of critical failure
- adapt to changing X server scenarios such as utilizing VNC && additional screens
- power management to maximize battery utilization
- drivers specific to Lenovo Thinkpad hardware

### AWESOMEWM theme configuration 

One of the portions of my development environment that maintains continuity is the general theme of Awesome Window Manager, which is slightly modified from its desktop equalivalent in these dotfiles to make it more friendly to the typically single screen and mobile environment implied by its deployment on a laptop. 

One of my irritations with Awesome configurations I have utilized as examples in constructing my own is the lack of implementations in differing contexts. While I can understand limiting computer us to one's work environment, if one is rather compartmentalized and does not appreciate development as I do, except that many of these configurations would lend themselves to varied deployments across one's systems and use cases. By offering these personal and consistent configurations in these varied use cases I am able to demonstrate how the overall theme can be employeed and the flexibility of this theme, which is relatively rather high.
