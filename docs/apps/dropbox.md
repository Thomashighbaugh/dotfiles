# Dropbox 

Included in this repository is an installation script that is stored in `home/dropbox`. It is not invoked during the set up process as it requires you to use your web browser to login to your dropbox account and because locally I use an SD Card to mirror said account's files, which requires a bit of local set up. Nonetheless the script is there still to help aid in the process.
