# Awesome Window Manager

This is the center piece of my configuration overall, a huge and feature rich configuration of the Awesome Window Manager that is also the centerpiece of the Electric Tantra Linux.

Documentation for it is coming soon and will be available on its repository [here](https://github.com/the-Electric-Tantra-Linux/awesome).
