# Dunst

Dunst is a notification daemon that let's you know about important, or unimportant, events by flashing a window on screen to indicate the event.This is an essential part of modern Desktop Environments, that is actually useful unlike many "modern" features, thus is included here despite the fact I have set up an alternative in AwesomeWM that I prefer to use while using it (and it is the primary WM I use, defaulting to it in almost every case except for when I break my configuration and boot into XFCE or QTile).

## Configuration Features

The `dunstrc` file provides only basic modifications of the dunst program, setting the timeout to 20 seconds, changing the colors to match the `vice base16 color scheme` and setting the all-important border-radius setting I prefer. Thus it is essentially only configured to fit into the overall look of the system without being too jarring to behold.
