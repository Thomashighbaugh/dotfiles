# Void Linux Provisioning Script

## Benefits of 'Home-Rolling' My Install Script

- finer grain of control
- automates package installation to provision the system as well as configure it 
- use of custom functions enables setting options as I like/want/need them set 
- no need to bend the repositories topography around a tool, instead the tool (the script) is bent around the repository
- enables arbitrary staging of the process according to local needs and/or my flights of fancy
