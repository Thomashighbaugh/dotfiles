# Apps 

The `Apps` menu item brings up the list of graphical applications installed and provisioned by the installation script. These are applications that require a window server application (X11 or Wayland) to appropriately function and are the types of applications the most familiar to users of other operating systems. The submenu provides a litany of options, listed below with descriptions as to what is being installed and/or provisioned by that menu item.
