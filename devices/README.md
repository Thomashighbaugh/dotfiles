## Devices

The subdirectories here are specific to specific machines that I own, within them will topics related to the hardware and platform of the device which solves another lingering issue I had with my old dotfiles, as there wasn't as clear of a way to include any of that in the repository. 

To give potential users an idea of what each device is, in case they want to adapt parts of it, below is a description of some of each system's relevant features and intended usecase.
