# Shell Configuration 

The files found here are common to all shells (both bash which is also in this repo and zsh which is located [here](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/zsh) because its a beefier configuration that gets modified and maintained on its own cadence separate from these dotfiles as I use it more and experiment with the prompt often). Both shells are pretty similiar and can easily utilize the same files for aliases and certain environmental configurations contained in this subdirectory without issue and it achieves my goals. Keeping these files as a commonly utilized set of configurations used across the shells makes for more consistency if for one reason or another I need to use bash for something and thus will still have access to my aliases as having a copy for each shell seems rather excessive in my opinion. Common entrypoint `.profile` is symlinked into the home directory then calls the files with a loop that pulls everything in the subdirectory of this one called `configs`, same with aliases except that subdirectory is called `alias`. This means the dotfiles *must* be located at `~/dotfiles` or you can change the location the loop is running through to fit your fancy if you prefer something like `.dotfiles` or whatever.
