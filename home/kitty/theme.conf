# The foreground and background colors

 background_opacity 0.90

# The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
# opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
# supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
# X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
# cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
# background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
# powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
# use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
# not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
# default background color in your kitty config and not use a
# background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
# codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
# launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
# (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
# change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
# yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
# this setting when reloading the config will only work if
# dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

# Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

# Whether to tile or scale the background image.

# background_image_linear no

# When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
# should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

# Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
# keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
# decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
# Changing this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

# How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
# tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes
# it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the current
# background color for each window. This setting applies only if
# background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported or
# background_image is set.

# dim_opacity 0.75

# How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
# means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

 selection_foreground #1b1d24

# The foreground for text selected with the mouse. A value of none
# means to leave the color unchanged.

 selection_background #8B99BE

# The background for text selected with the mouse.


# The color table {{{

# The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
# dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
# remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.
