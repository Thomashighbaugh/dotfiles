# BASH 

I don't use bash often, but I still have a primitive configuration for it just in case I need it for something. The prompt I am using comes from Kali Linux originally, I like it and its informative while differing enough from my ZSH prompt enough to insure that I immeadiately notice if I am using BASH. 

Its rather sparatan as I use zsh primarily at the moment (I have gone back and forth in the past so it could happen again), I just find the features of ZSH more convenient (especially tab completion, which I know exists for bash or I could write it, just an example) and so have a separate repo [here](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/zsh) for its configuration that is much more expansive and features a custom prompt (and no `oh-my-zsh` overhead making it slow nor package management which I don't find useful for zsh personally. I just adapt into my configuration what I like from around the Github sphere as its less fickle that way once set in). 

Calls in the `.profile` file found at `../shell/profile` that provides cross shell aliases and configurations.
