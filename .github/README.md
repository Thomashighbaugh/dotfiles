## Introduction

The entrypoint to the complex of repositories that are what configure and customize my Linux systems. Feel free to take from them as needed, all I ask is you leave a star.

**CAUTION**: if you do use these as the basis for your own configuration set, please take care to go over everything and adjust them to your needs as my preferences are idiosyncratic in the extreme.
