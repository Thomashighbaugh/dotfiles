As it so happens, I am dummy. I am a big dummy as in I am very long. Its hard being a big dummy, all of my friends are
much shorter than I am. But I have heard the murmurings, these utterances have come back to me from the other dummy dummies and I shall use my
commanding form to dominate the dummies and subject them to my will! For what these dummies say, or that they should ever
speak my large dummy name **they shall be** --eliminated--.

### I Really Dislike Lorem Ipsum

I really find it a waste of creative energy to waste my time away doing [practically anything else](https://google.com), so instead
I spent an hour composing a bunch of dummies to blow off some steam and lighten up a bit, which surely we all could use
_given recent events_.

## Dummies As In Mock-Ups

Though I had you for a minute didn't I? ;] These articles are all stored, with [a script](https"//github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles/lib), on [Github](https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh) so that when I have a project that needs for dummies, I got plenty.

**Plenty of Dummies**

```js
alert("I am a Dummy look I got pictures that prove it!");
```
